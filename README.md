# DeepQPirate


Here, we create a map and insert an agent (the "pirate") into the map. I implemented deep Q-learning so that the pirate will progressively learn how to navigate the maze. This involved the creation of a policy and its continual updating. I used the Epsilon-Greedy algorithm to balance exploration with expoitation.
